            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Purpose:</p>
            <p>
                This Agreement ensures compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
                of 1996 (HIPAA), the HITECH Act, and related regulations. It governs how ProMed Health Plus, LLC 
                ("ProMed") may receive, use, or disclose Protected Health Information (PHI) while performing services 
                for the Provider, including insurance verification (IVR) submissions, billing assistance, order 
                management, and logistics related to wound-care biologic products.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Definitions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Covered Entity:</strong> The Provider, as defined by 45 CFR § 160.103.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Associate:</strong> ProMed Health Plus, LLC.</li>
                <li><strong>PHI:</strong> Protected Health Information as defined by HIPAA.</li>
                <li><strong>Breach:</strong> Any impermissible use or disclosure of PHI not permitted by this Agreement or HIPAA.</li>
                <li><strong>Portal:</strong> The secure ProMed online platform through which the Provider submits IVRs, documentation, and orders.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Permitted Uses and Disclosures:</p>
            <p>ProMed may use or disclose PHI only to:</p>

                <li>Comply with applicable law, court orders, or lawful requests.</li>
                <li>De-identify PHI for internal quality improvement or analytics, never for marketing or resale.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All uses and disclosures shall comply with the minimum necessary standard required by 45 CFR § 164.502(b).
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Safeguards</p>
            <p>
                (A) General Safeguards: ProMed shall implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards consistent with 45 CFR §§
                164.308–312 to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. Subcontractors who receive PHI from ProMed must
                sign written agreements imposing the same restrictions and protections.
            </p>
            <p>
                (B) Portal and Electronic Access: ProMed maintains a secure, HIPAA-compliant Provider Portal that enables the Provider to submit
                IVRs, patient documentation, order forms, and related data necessary for product distribution and billing. ProMed will implement and
                maintain appropriate safeguards within the Portal, including but not limited to:

                <li>Continuous system monitoring and audit logs</li>
                <li>Routine data backup and disaster-recovery measures</li>
                <li>Hosting on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Provider agrees to:</p>

            </ol>
            <p>

                <li>Maintain and furnish an accounting of disclosures as required under 45 CFR § 164.528.</li>

                Each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from any claim, loss, or liability arising from its own negligence, willful
